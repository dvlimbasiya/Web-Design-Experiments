# Web-Design-Experiments

These are bunch of CSS3 experiments I've done in my free time. Everything you see is __pure CSS and nothing else__. All the experiments are testing on latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera, on Windows and Linux.

## Edge Shadows

Page edge shadows that persist even if the page is scrolled. Gives a nice inset effect.

## Perspective Focus

Perspectively Focusable Menubar, when one of the menu items is hovered, rest of the items get faded, and current is focused.
