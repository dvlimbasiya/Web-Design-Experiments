# Web-Design-Experiments

These are bunch of CSS3 experiments I've done in my free time. Everything you see is __pure CSS and nothing else__. All the experiments are tested on latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera, on Windows and Linux. You can test all these and my other experiments at my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kushalpandya) page.

## Edge Shadows

Page edge shadows that persist even if the page is scrolled. Gives a nice inset effect. Those ribbon icons are not images. :-) [Demo](http://cdpn.io/qanpe)

## Perspective Focus

Perspectively Focusable Menubar, when one of the menu items is hovered, rest of the items get faded, and current is focused. [Demo](http://cdpn.io/kdlqf)
